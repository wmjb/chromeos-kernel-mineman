description:
  A USB Type-C switch represents a component which routes USB Type-C data
  lines to various protocol host controllers (e.g USB, VESA DisplayPort,
  Thunderbolt etc.) depending on which mode the Type-C port, port partner
  and cable are operating in. It can also modify lane routing based on
  the orientation of a connected Type-C peripheral.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: typec-switch

  mode-switch:
    type: boolean
    description: Specify that this switch can handle alternate mode switching.

  orientation-switch:
    type: boolean
    description: Specify that this switch can handle orientation switching.
